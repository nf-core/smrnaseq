# nf-core/smrnaseq Output

## Introduction

**nf-core/smrnaseq** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for small RNA sequencing data analysis.

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [FastQC](#fastqc) - read quality control
- [TrimGalore](#trimgalore) - adapter trimming
- [Bowtie2](#bowtie2) - contamination filtering
- [Bowtie](#bowtie) - alignment against mature miRNAs and miRNA precursors (hairpins)
- [SAMtools](#samtools) - alignment result processing and feature counting
- [edgeR](#edger) - normalization, MDS plot and sample pairwise distance heatmap
- [Bowtie](#bowtie) - alignment against reference genome for QC purpose
- [mirtop](#mirtop) - miRNA and isomiR annotation
- [miRDeep2](#mirdeep2) - known and novel miRNA annotation
- [miRTrace](#mirtrace) - a comprehensive tool for QC purpose
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - aggregate report, describing results of the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

## TrimGalore

[TrimGalore](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) is used for removal of adapter contamination and trimming of low quality regions. TrimGalore uses [Cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt) for adapter trimming and runs FastQC after it finishes.

MultiQC reports the percentage of bases removed by TrimGalore in the _General Statistics_ table, along with a line plot showing where reads were trimmed.

**Output directory: `results/trimmed`**

Contains FastQ files with quality and adapter trimmed reads for each sample, along with a log file describing the trimming.

- `sample_trimmed.fq.gz` Trimmed FastQ data
- `sample.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txt` Trimming report (describes which parameters that were used)
- `sample_trimmed_fastqc.html`
- `sample_trimmed_fastqc.zip` FastQC report for trimmed reads

This is an example of the output we can get:

## Bowtie2

[Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) is used to align the reads to user-defined databases of contaminants.

MultiQC reports the number of reads that were removed by each of the contaminant databases.

## Bowtie

[Bowtie](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) is used for mapping adapter trimmed reads against the mature miRNAs and miRNA precursors (hairpins) of the chosen database [miRBase](http://www.mirbase.org/) or [MirGeneDB](https://mirgenedb.org/).

**Output directory: `results/samtools`**

- `sample_mature.bam`: The aligned BAM file of alignment against mature miRNAs
- `sample_mature_unmapped.fq.gz`: Unmapped reads against mature miRNAs _This file will be used as input for the alignment against miRNA precursors (hairpins)_
- `sample_mature_hairpin.bam`: The aligned BAM file of alignment against miRNA precursors (hairpins) that didn't map to the mature
- `sample_mature_hairpin_unmapped.fq.gz`: Unmapped reads against miRNA precursors (hairpins)
- `sample_mature_hairpin_genome.bam`: The aligned BAM file of alignment against that didn't map to the precursor.

## SAMtools

[SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) is used for sorting and indexing the output BAM files from Bowtie. In addition, the numbers of features are counted with the `idxstats` option.

**Output directory: `results/samtools/samtools_stats`**

- `stats|idxstats|flagstat`: BAM stats for each of the files listed above.

## edgeR

[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) is an R package used for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles.

**Output directory: `results/edgeR`**

- `[mature/hairpin]_normalized_CPM.txt` TMM normalized counts of reads aligned to mature miRNAs/miRNA precursors (hairpins)
- `[mature/hairpin]_edgeR_MDS_plot.pdf` Multidimensional scaling plot of all samples based on the expression profile of mature miRNAs/miRNA precursors (hairpins)
- `[mature/hairpin]_CPM_heatmap.pdf` Heatmap based on the expression profile of mature miRNAs/miRNA precursors (hairpins)
- `[mature/hairpin]_log2CPM_sample_distances_dendrogram.pdf` Dendrograms of distance among samples based on the expression profile of mature miRNAs/miRNA precursors (hairpins)
- `[mature/hairpin]_log2CPM_sample_distances_heatmap.pdf` Pairwise correlation of samples based on the expression profile of mature miRNAs/miRNA precursors (hairpins)

**Example**: MDS plot of 10 samples based on their expression profiles of mature miRNAs. Here we can see that samples cluster based on different sample types and library preparation kits.

## mirtop

[mirtop](https://github.com/miRTop/mirtop) is used to parse the BAM files from `bowtie` alignment, and produce a [mirgff3](https://github.com/miRTop/mirGFF3) file with information about miRNAs and isomirs.

**Output directory: `results/mirtop`**

- `mirtop.gff`: [mirgff3](https://github.com/miRTop/mirGFF3) file
- `mirtop.tsv`: tabular file of the previous file for easy integration with downstream analysis.
- `mirtop_rawData.tsv`: File compatible with [isomiRs](http://lpantano.github.io/isomiRs/reference/IsomirDataSeqFromMirtop.html) Bioconductor package to perform isomiRs analysis.
- `mirna.tsv`: tabular file with miRNA counts after summarizing unique isomiRs for each miRNA

## miRDeep2

[miRDeep2](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/content/mirdeep2-documentation) is used for the identification of novel and known miRNAs in deep sequencing data.

## miRTrace

[miRTrace](https://github.com/friedlanderlab/mirtrace) is a quality control specifically for small RNA sequencing data (smRNA-Seq). Each sample is characterized by profiling sequencing quality, read length, sequencing depth and miRNA complexity and also the amounts of miRNAs versus undesirable sequences (derived from tRNAs, rRNAs and sequencing artifacts).

**Output directory: `results/mirtrace`**

- `mirtrace-report.html` An interactive HTML report summarizing all output statistics from miRTrace
- `mirtrace-results.json` A JSON file with all output statistics from miRTrace
- `mirtrace-stats-*.tsv` Tab-separated statistics files
- `qc_passed_reads.all.collapsed` FASTA file per sample with sequence reads that passed QC in miRTrace
- `qc_passed_reads.rnatype_unknown.collapsed` FASTA file per sample with unknown reads in the RNA type analysis

Refer to the [tool manual](https://github.com/friedlanderlab/mirtrace/blob/master/release-bundle-includes/manual.pdf) for detailed specifications about output files. Here is an example of the RNA types plot that you will see:

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
