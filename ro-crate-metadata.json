It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!\n\nOn release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/smrnaseq/results).\n\n## Online videos\n\nA short talk about the history, current status and functionality on offer in this pipeline was given by Lorena Pantano (@lpantano) on [9th November 2021](https://youtu.be/4YLQ2VwpCJE) as part of the nf-core/bytesize series.\n\nYou can find numerous talks on the nf-core events page from various topics including writing pipelines/modules in Nextflow DSL2, using nf-core tooling, running nf-core pipelines as well as more generic content like contributing to Github. Please check them out!\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps.

Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nYou can test the pipeline as follows:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/smrnaseq \\\n   -profile test,docker \\\n  --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\nIn order to use the pipeline with your own data, first prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:\n\n`samplesheet.csv`:\n\n```csv\nsample,fastq_1\nClone1_N1,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/C1-N1-R1_S4_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nClone1_N3,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/C1-N3-R1_S6_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nClone9_N1,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/C9-N1-R1_S7_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nClone9_N2,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/C9-N2-R1_S8_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nClone9_N3,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/C9-N3-R1_S9_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nControl_N1,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/Ctl-N1-R1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nControl_N2,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/Ctl-N2-R1_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\nControl_N3,s3://ngi-igenomes/test-data/smrnaseq/Ctl-N3-R1_S3_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nEach row represents a fastq file (single-end).\n\nNow, you can run the pipeline using:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/smrnaseq \\\n   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>,<protocol> \\\n  --input samplesheet.csv \\\n  --genome 'GRCh37' \\\n  --mirtrace_species 'hsa' \\\n  --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Remember to add a protocol as an additional profile (such as `illumina`, `nexttflex`, `qiaseq` or `cats`) when running with your own data. If no protocol is indicated via -profile, the pipeline will likely fail. Alternatively, if needed to run a custom protocol, parameters must be set manually, and auto-detect feature is available. See [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/smrnaseq/usage) for more details about these profiles.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/smrnaseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/smrnaseq/parameters).\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/smrnaseq/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the\n[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/smrnaseq/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nnf-core/smrnaseq was originally written by P.
